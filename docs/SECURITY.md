## CSP Scan

In order to pass CSP scans you need to:

1) Make your app return the csp headers. To do this i used express-csp as we are using express.
We used the following

Content-Security-Policy:
default-src 'self';
img-src 'self' https://randomuser.me http://placehold.it;object-src 'none';
script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-04111658';
style-src * data: http://* 'unsafe-inline'

Notes: Everything should be secure with the following exceptions.

img-src -> We need to add some paths for random image generator sites we use in the examples on blockgrid, hierarcy, and image components. If you use these you may need to set this to 'self'.

style-src -> We need to allow the soho script to do inline styles. We set this to http://* for the various sites we use. You should set this to your sites. If we don't do this many components cannot function for example things with height, width, top, left

    - datagrid column widths
    - dragging / dropping
    - popup position

2) Replace all `style="display: none;"` with class `hidden`
3) In application menu code remove inline `style="display: none;"`
4) If testing with CSP mitigator https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csp-mitigator/gijlobangojajlbodabkpjpheeeokhfa?hl=en

Then not that we can test pages like http://localhost:4000/components/personalize/example-index
Using:
script-src 'self';
style-src 'self';
frame-ancestors 'self';
object-src 'none'

These errors still occur:

* False positive on elements without a nonce attribute (3) (or pages have auto nonce)
* Libraries that allow strict-dynamic bypass (1) (it warns about jQuery but the latest version does no longer have an Eval in it 3.3.1)
