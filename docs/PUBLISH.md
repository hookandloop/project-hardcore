# Dev Ops / Publishing Tasks and Notes

## Link the Private npm Registry
To be able to publish to [npm.infor.com](http://npm.infor.com:4873) you need to add an authorized npm user on your system...

```bash
npm adduser --registry http://npm.infor.com:4873 --scope=@infor
npm set registry http://registry.npmjs.org
```

The verdaccio username is admin and password is Ap5T7IPF2o, use your regular email address.


## Check Published npm Tags

```bash
npm info ids-enterprise dist-tags
npm view ids-enterprise versions
```

## Delete a npm Tag

```bash
npm adduser --registry http://npm.infor.com:4873 --scope=@infor
npm dist-tag rm ids-enterprise develop
```

## Merge a fix to a branch

```bash
git checkout release/4.2.0
git cherry-pick 802b102fda5420a0f714d9d0efa5eff635fe77d9 //from http://git.infor.com/projects/SOHO/repos/controls/commits
git push
git checkout master
```

## Set tools for AWS Publish

- Also install AWS for testing and configuring http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
- Once installed run aws configure to enter the keys in the right spot http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html

```
npm view ids-enterprise versions
npm view @infor/sohoxi-angular versions

npm info @infor/sohoxi-angular dist-tags
npm info ids-enterprise dist-tags

```

* Test New and old links for example:
http://usalvlhlpool1.infor.com/4.5.0/components/
http://usalvlhlpool1.infor.com/4.6.0-rc/components/

You may have to run this for new sites

```
curl -X POST -u hookandloop:hookandloop http://usalvlhlpool1/swarm/update_config
```


## Deploy Site Operations

* Delete the old version from pool server usalvlhlpool1
```bash
