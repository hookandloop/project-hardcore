# :tada: Soho XI Has Moved to Github! :tada:

Starting at the end of release `4.6.0`, we moved the Soho XI codebase to Github! What this means is now anyone can view and contribute to the codebase.

There are two ways to go about using Github for development (as the [Bitbucket](http://git.infor.com/projects/SOHO/repos/controls/browse) will eventually be deprecated):

You can go to https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise and fork the repo.


# Infor Design System's Enterprise Components

Infor Design System's Enterprise component library is a framework-independent UI library consisting of CSS and JS that provides Infor product development teams, partners, and customers the tools to create user experiences that are approachable, focused, relevant, perceptive.

For guidelines on when and where to use the components see the [design.infor.com](http://design.infor.com).

## Getting the code into your project

### npmjs

To install, run:

```bash
npm install --save ids-enterprise
```

The files can then be seen in the folder `./node_modules/ids-enterprise/dist`

### CDN

You can now get the scripts and CSS from a CDN on AWS. For example, the paths for the 4.3.5 releases would be:

```
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/js/sohoxi.js
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/js/sohoxi.min.js
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/css/dark-theme.css
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/css/dark-theme.min.css
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/css/dark-theme.css
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/css/dark-theme.min.css
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/css/light-theme.css
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/css/light-theme.min.css
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/svg/svg.html
https://cdn.hookandloop.infor.com/sohoxi/4.3.5/dist/svg/svg-extended.html
```

Versions available on CDN are: 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.3.5

Note: There may be a cost involved to using this with Infor's amazon s3 account so keep this in mind when using.

## Running the development project

### Install pre-requisites

* Install `node` for following the [directions for your OS](http://nodejs.org/)
* On Windows, you'll need to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure the version is at least `2.5.0` but not Python 3.
* Also on Windows, you should run `git config core.autocrlf false`

### Clone the repo

* Clone the repo using `git`: `git clone https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise.git`
* `cd` into the repo directory

### Running the app

From within the project folder:

* Run `npm start` to build and start the web server
* Make a new terminal window and from within your project folder run `npx grunt watch` to watch for any file changes and rebuild
* Open up [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in a browser to see the local app

Note that at this point any changes you make will cause SASS to recompile and the browser will reload.

You’ll see documentation pages unless they aren’t generated, then you’ll see the demos and directory lists only.  You can optionally run `npm run documentation` to see the full component documentation.

### Running the tests

Functional tests are the primary way we test the codebase. To run the tests, run `npm run functional:local`.

### Editor Plugins

This project uses `eslint` and `editorconfig`. You may want to add the following plugins to your editor to help comply with our coding standards: `eslint` for [Atom](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), as well as `editorconfig` for [Atom](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig#readme) and [VS Code](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode)

## Documentation

Soho XI's current documentation can be found at [design.infor.com/code/ids-enterprise/latest](https://design.infor.com/code/ids-enterprise/latest).

You can also find a subset of documentation at [`localhost:4000/components`](http://localhost:4000/components) when running the project locally. To contribute you can edit the `readme.md` files for a component or add [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/) comments to the source files for inline settings and events.
