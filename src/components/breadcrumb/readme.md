## Code Example

This is an example showing a breadcrumb component with four items. The current item should be last and have the `current` class. All items take the hyperlink style via class `hyperlink`. However, based on background element (header or page) the style may adopt and change. The `disabled` class can be added to prevent links from being clickable, however they can still be focused because the hyperlink element cannot contain a disabled property by valid HTML standards.

This component is entirely HTML and CSS, to update contents you will need to implement the logic to replace the link elements in the hierarchy.

```html
<nav class="breadcrumb">
  <ol aria-label="breadcrumb">
    <li>
      <a href="#" id="home" class="hyperlink hide-focus">Home</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#" id="second-item" class="hyperlink hide-focus">Second Item</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#" id="third-item" class="hyperlink hide-focus">Third Item</a>
    </li>
    <li class="current">Fourth Item <span class="audible">Current</span></li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

## Breadcrumb Positioning and Variations

The above example just shows an in page breadcrumb. But usually the breadcrumb would be the top level element in the page. In some cases it is actually in or just below the header. These examples are showing in the [patterns section](../patterns).

Examples:

- [In Header](../patterns/navigation-breadcrumbs) this variation is used when the breadcrumb acts as the sole top level navigation.
- [Below Header](../patterns/navigation-breadcrumbs-alternate.) this variation is used when the breadcrumb acts as a secondary top level navigation. For example if its part of the page pattern.

## Accessibility

- Add an `aria-label` with the localized term for "breadcrumb"
- `audible` spans may need to be added to indicate levels

## Testability

- Please refer to the [Application Testability Checklist](https://design.infor.com/resources/application-testability-checklist) for further details.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves focus to the link. A second <kbd>tab</kbd> moves focus to the next focusable item.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> executes the link.

## Upgrading from 3.X

- "Collapsing Lists" is Deprecated
- Markup has entirely changed, see the updated code example
