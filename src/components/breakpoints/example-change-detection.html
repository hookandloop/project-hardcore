    <h2>Breakpoints Test: Event-based Change Detection</h2>
    <p>
      Related JIRA Ticket: <a class="hyperlink" href="https://jira.infor.com/browse/SOHO-7087" target="_blank">SOHO-7087</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      An event gets triggered on a Soho application's body tag whenever the Soho CSS determines that a breakpoint change should be made.  In any application that implements Soho UX, there will be an <span class="code">::after</span> pseudo-element appended to the body tag with a content property that describes the current breakpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a small utility, <span class="code">Soho.breakpoints</span>, that has a few convenience functions for working with the breakpoint system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this test, causing this page to have an orientation change or resize event that results in a new breakpoint change will cause a toast message to appear containing the custom event's data.
