## Code Example

The color picker is consists of a input with class="colorpicker". It can be initialized manually or with the page initializer. Once initialized it functions similar to a dropdown except that the list is showing color a color pallet in the popup. A tooltip shows the hex code to be inserted. After selecting the hex code is inserted.

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="background-color">Color Picker</label>
  <input class="colorpicker" value="#ffa800" id="background-color" type="text" />
</div>
```

## Behavior Guidelines

- The Color Picker only supports colors within a pre-configured palette (specified by the developer). Users cannot manually enter values, but can only select from the Color Picker.
- Some use cases require the ability to clear selection (i.e., remove color/restore default color).

## Accessibility
