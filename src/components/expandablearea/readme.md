An expandable area is a `<div>` with the `expandable-area` class. Inside that element would be a header with a `title` and a pane. The pane has the class `expandable-pane` and is the area that will hide and show.

An expandable area content pane can be either collapsed or expanded. During initialization, the expandable area's base element `$('.expandable-area')` is checked for the CSS class `is-expanded`. If found, the expandable area content pane will open automatically.

It's possible to keep the area open by default by adding the class `is-expanded` to the `expandable-area`. You can also add a second pane with class `expandable-visible-panel`. This pane will always remain open.

```html
<div class="expandable-area">
  <div class="expandable-header">
    <span class="title">Procurement</span>
  </div>
  <div class="expandable-pane">
    <div class="content">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Code Example - Toggle Area

Its possible to assign a custom button that can toggle a specific area using the expandable-area component.  To do this place the class `expandable-area-trigger` on a button inside the expandable area. Also you can optionally specify two icons for open and closed state. Then the element in the expandable-pane will be toggled.

```html
<div class="expandable-area">
  <button type="button" class="btn expandable-area-trigger" id="trigger-btn">
    <span>Employee</span>
    <svg class="icon icon-closed" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
      <use href="#icon-caret-down"></use>
    </svg>
    <svg class="icon icon-opened" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
      <use href="#icon-caret-up"></use>
    </svg>
  </button>
  <div class="expandable-pane">
    <div class="content">
      <p>
