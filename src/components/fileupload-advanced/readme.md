The advanced file upload control just needs a `<div>` with the class `fileupload-advanced` in which to draw its contents.

```html
<div class="fileupload-advanced">
</div>
```

This is done by using an HTML5 drag and drop feature, so is only supported well on modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 11 or later.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Not keyboard friendly at this time. Will need a browse button.

## States and Variations

- Error
- Success / Fail

## Responsive Guidelines

-   The `<div>` will size to parent but recommend default size.
