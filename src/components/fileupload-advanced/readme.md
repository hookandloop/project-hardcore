The advanced file upload control just needs a `<div>` with the class `fileupload-advanced` in which to draw its contents.

```html
<div id="fileupload-advanced" class="fileupload-advanced">
</div>
```

This is done by using an HTML5 drag and drop feature, so is only supported well on modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 11 or later.
