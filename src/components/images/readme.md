The image component is a CSS only component to handle placeholder images, empty images, and the various sizes of images that can appear in an application. Placeholder images can be in sizes `image-lg`, `image-md`, and `image-sm`.

## Code Example

This example shows how to invoke a small sized placeholder image.

```html
<div class="image-sm placeholder">
  <svg class="icon" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
    <use href="#icon-insert-image"></use>
  </svg>
  <span class="audible">Placeholder Image</span>
</div>
```

## Accessibility

- For images always use an `alt` tag, which is read by screen readers

## Testability

- Please refer to the [Application Testability Checklist](https://design.infor.com/resources/application-testability-checklist) for further details.

## Code Tips

The <a href="https://design.infor.com/code/ids-enterprise/latest/demo/images/example-image-list?font=source-sans" target="_blank">example image list pattern</a> is created by using a toolbar above the block grid layout.

## Upgrading from 3.X

- Block grid / Image List partially replaces the carousel in 3.x
