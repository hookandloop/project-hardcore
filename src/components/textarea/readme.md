## Configuration Details

1. [Text Area  Examples]( ../components/textarea/example-index)

## Behavior Guidelines

- Text Areas can either have a fixed height, in which case a vertical scrollbar appears when the content exceeds the available space, or the height can expand to accommodate the amount of text.
- Text Areas should always have a minimum height of 3 text lines.

## Code Example

A Text Area is a standard css / html element. To implement a Text Area, you can insert a standard textarea element and add the class="textarea". Also be sure to create a meaningful label which is linked to the input.

You can optionally add the class="resizable" to the input to allow it to be resized.

You can optionally set a placeholder for inline text such as "type your comments here" etc.

You can optionally set a maxlength attribute which is the maximum number of characters that can be used. If you do this, a count will be shown below the input to assist the user.

Text areas support:

-   Dirty Indicator
-   Error validation
-   Required Validation
-   Disabled/Enabled

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="description">Notes (resizable)</label>
  <textarea id="description" class="resizable" name="description" placeholder="Type your notes here..."></textarea>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="description-max">Notes (maxlength)</label>
  <textarea id="description-max" class="textarea" maxlength="90" name="description-max" >Line One</textarea>
</div>
```

## Implementation Tips

- Printing is supported now. To do this we need a second shadow element in the page which is shown in the print media query.

## Accessibility

- Make sure the label matches and is meaninful
- Add aria-required if required

## States and Variations

The supported states are identical to the Text Input Field.

## Responsive Guidelines

- Size is 450px but will reduce to fit parent container

## Upgrading from 3.X

- Change class inforLabel to label
- Change class inforTextArea to textarea
- Not new syntax for required.
- Be sure to wrap inside of a field div
- Instead of class required on the input you should add this class to the label, and add aria-required and data-validate
