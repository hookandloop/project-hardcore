## Code Example

This example shows how to invoke a dount bar chart with a dataset controlling the values.

```javascript
  var donutData = [{
    data: [{
        name: 'Component A',
        value: 30
    }, {
        name: 'Component B',
        value: 40
    }],
    centerLabel: 'Donut Chart'
  }];

  $('#pie-donut-example').chart({type: 'donut', dataset: donutData}).on('selected', function (e, elem, args) {
    console.log(e, elem, args);
  });
```

## Accessibility

- The contrast and actual colors can be a concern for visibility impaired and color blind people. However, you can customize the color by passing higher contrast colors.

## Code Tips

You can control the size of the donut chart by setting the size of the parent element the donut lives in.
This may include possibly using an inset margin in some cases.
