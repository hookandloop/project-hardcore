The Soho visibility classes allow elements to become conditionally visible or hidden based on breakpoint size.  They also provide a way to conveniently change the CSS `display` property on a per-breakpoint basis.

## Configuration Examples

1. [All Examples]( ../components/visibility/example-index)
2. [Multiple classes at once]( ../components/visibility/example-multiple-visibility-classes)
