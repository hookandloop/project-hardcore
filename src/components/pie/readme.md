## Code Example

This example shows how to invoke a pie bar chart with a dataset controlling the values.

```javascript
  var pieData = [{
      data: [{
          name: 'Component A',
          value: 10.1,
          id: 'A',
          tooltip: 'Component A <b>{{percent}}</b>'
      }, {
          name: 'Component B',
          value: 12.2,
          id: 'B',
          tooltip: 'Component B <b>{{percent}}</b>'
      }, {
          name: 'Component C',
          value: 14.35,
          id: 'C',
          tooltip: 'Component C Is Very Cool<b>{{percent}}</b>'
      }]
    }];

  $('#pie-chart-example').chart({type: 'pie', dataset: pieData});

```

## Accessibility

- The contrast and actual colors can be a concern for visibility impaired and color blind people. However, you can customize the color by passing different contrast colors.

## Code Tips

You can control the size of the donut chart by setting the size of the parent element the pie chart lives in.
This may include possibly using an inset margin in some cases.
